# Network Messaging Tool (TCP Client-Server)

- Built a client-server application in C using TCP sockets for sending and receiving text messages, handling all socket operations.
- Implemented client-side logic for user input, length-prefix encoding, and byte-order conversion.
- Utilized standard C networking libraries (sys/socket.h, arpa/inet.h, netinet/in.h) to establish reliable connections.
- Implemented error handling for connection failures, invalid input, and transmission errors
